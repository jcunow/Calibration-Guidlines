.... 


#### Can you contribute?
Yes, if you have 1) minirhizotron tubes installed (or planning to do soon), 2) you have scanned these tubes, and 3) you have access to calibrate your setup in-situ - you are absolutly more than welcome to contribute. After that, you need to do two things: send root scans & complete this data sheet [Link] to the best of your ability. We need some calibration parameter and information about the root scans themselves. Ideally, you also send complementary segmented Images where roots have been identified by manually tracing or automated with AI. 

#### What do you get out of it?
You are being a great chap and helping out feels good of course :)  Coauthorship will be considered given additional contribution which will be announced later on.

   *Calibrate*
* Take a ruler, a angle measurements device (although not terribly precise, all modern phones can measure angles), and the calibration protocol to your tubes.
* Note down the tube insertion angle, the excess tube extrusion above ground, and the tube diameter for every tube (if they differ). This calibrations are essential.
* We need to know where the scanner started it's rotation in the tube. This allows us to identify which area in the scans represent upward, downward, and sidefacing areas of the tube. Please try to remember 

  
   *Prepare the Root Scans*
 * The root scan images need to be identifyable with ID/Plot
 * We will handle your images confidentially of course, however, you may rename your images to censor sensitive information if so desired. We recommend a naming scheme like: "Site_ID_Date"
