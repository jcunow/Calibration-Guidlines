#### Why do we need to calibrate our tubes?
1) to unlock the potential of continues root distributions and gain 'true' depth information for any root pixel.  
2) to account for potential bias. I say potnetial, because it has not been assessed yet. Our goal is to quantify how much bias your tube configuration has. Calibrating your tubes helps the community 




#### Can you contribute to the Bias Estimation Project?
Yes, you are absolutly more than welcome to contribute. You only need to calibrate your Minirhizotron Tubes. We are looking for 
After that, you need to do two things: send root scans & complete this data sheet [Link] to the best of your ability. We need some calibration parameter and information about the root scans themselves. 
Ideally, you also send complementary segmented Images where roots have been identified by manually tracing or automated with AI. 

Does my Data Fit:
- [x] Currently active Minirhizotrons *OR* soon to be installed Minirhizotrons *OR* alreday calibrated in the past
- [x] Permission to share root scans for reanalysis (consider censoring relevant information e.g., treatments if necessary)
- [x] Willing to calibrate and compile meta-data
If all of the above apply, we would be happy to have you on board.


#### What do you get out of it?
You are being a great chap and helping out feels good of course :) 

 
#### Calibration items - what you need to do:

   *Calibrate*
  * You need a ruler/tape measure and an angle measurements device (all modern phones can measure angles (typically 1-2° deviation)). 
    If you are unsure about the specifics, just send me an email.

    *For every tube:*
  1) Note down the tube insertion angle. Apps are usually called something like "spirit level", "angle meter", "bubble level", or similarly. If you use your phone, your app needs to display both vertical and horizontal tilt.
      * Importantly, keep other tilt angles at 0°. Please pay attention to which angle you actually measured!    
      * Tipp: you can use the flat ring surface to obtain the perpendicular angle to the insertion angle. 
  2) Note down where soil starts in the image.
      * Often, tape will be used to block incoming light. However, this results in excess tape in the image. Please give it your best estimate.
      * If your upper most scan is below the soil surface, we want to know how much!
      * Tipp: if you use fixpoints to slide your scanner up/downwards, you can use the distance from the fixpoint to the soil (measured on the topside of the tube). Knowing your scanner model, we can back calculate how much tape excess you have.
  4) Note down what the rotational-starting position of the scanner is. It is important to know whether the first row in your scan represent the top or bottom side of the tube. Top, Bottom, or to the Side is a reasonable estimate in most cases (but higher accuracy will improve depth mapping accuracy).
      

  *For every site (usually):* 
  1)  Note down the outer tube diameter. A diameter of 5.7 cm (2.25 in)  and 7 cm (2.75 in) is very common.

   *Prepare the Root Scans*
 * The root scan images need to be identifyable with Site and ID/Plot. 
 * We will handle your images confidentially of course, however, you may rename your images to censor sensitive information if so desired. We recommend a naming scheme like: "Site_ID"
